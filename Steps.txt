1. **Understand the Hardware**: Familiarize yourself with the TM4C123GH6PM board and its GPIOs. Understand how to interface with the Fume Sensor, Ultrasonic Sensor, and Magnetic Sensor. Also, learn about the Bluetooth module and how to use it for communication.

2. **Setup the Development Environment**: Install all necessary software tools for development. This might include an IDE (like Code Composer Studio or Keil uVision), compiler, and debugger.

3. **Sensor Interfacing**: Start by writing code to interface with each sensor individually. Test each sensor to ensure you're able to read data from it correctly.

4. **Implement Danger Detection Logic**: Once you're able to read data from the sensors, implement the logic to detect danger based on the sensor readings.

5. **Data Transmission Over Light**: Work on the light communication between the sender and receiver platforms. You can start by simply turning on an LED when danger is detected.

6. **Data Transmission Over Bluetooth**: Simultaneously, you can also work on sending data over Bluetooth to a mobile phone. There are many tutorials available online on how to send data from a microcontroller to a mobile phone over Bluetooth.

7. **Alarm System**: On the receiver platform, write code to turn on the lamp and buzzer, and display a message on the LCD when a signal is received.

8. **Implement Control Buttons**: Finally, implement the start/stop and mute functionalities using pushbuttons.

Remember, the key to a successful project is incremental development and testing. Make sure each part is working before moving on to the next. Good luck! ðŸ˜Š
